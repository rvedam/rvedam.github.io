<p>I code in many languages, although Common Lisp is one of my favorites. I code in
it for fun and education, although recently I have been looking into do more work
with it for some side projects. Hopefully, time permitting, these projects and
ideas will lead to something that I can show all in the blogosphere (if not it&rsquo;ll
be a github repo for people to fork, and hopefully critique)</p>
<p>I am an advocate for functional programming and am interested in its role in the
technology landscape as it gets wider adoption. I am also interested in the
continuous evolution of both the field of computer science and the software industry
in general. To further pursue these interests, I organize and give talks online for
the Atlanta Functional Programming Meetup. A couple of these activities include
the following study groups (held virtually weekly and livestreamed via Youtube):</p>
<ul>
<li>CL Study group</li>
<li>Haskell Study Group</li>
</ul>
<p>Please join us! More information about these meetups are available on the
Atlanta Functional Programming meetup page.</p>
