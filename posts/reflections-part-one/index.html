        <p>September 1st marks 16 years since I graduated from University of Illinois with
my BS in Mathematics &amp; Computer Science, and I entered the software industry
officially. A lot has changed since then, from how we develop software to how
we manage software projects, to how software companies are established. So much
has changed so quickly in the last 16 years that it prompted me to start looking
back to where the industry was at the time I started, in an effort to understand
the evolution and more importantly figure out if some modern trends were making
more sense than others.  I came to a few realizations about this, and I thought
I&rsquo;d write them down here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some of you might ask &ldquo;Why write about this now?&rdquo;. The world as
we know it has transformed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and while many industries
are still adjusting to this new environment with remote work, the software
industry has been blazing trails with many companies actually shutting down their
facilities in favor of a full remote workforce (more on this observation later).
While one might think this is unprecedented even for the software community, this
was a long time coming and was one of the realizations that I had while I
embarked on this journey into looking back and understand how we got here.</p>
<p>As I write these down, I hope to start up a discussion to see if other folks
are observing similar things and are coming to the same conclusions. Hopefully,
we can have a meaningful discussion, maybe even figure other changes that are
required.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. Stay Tuned!</p>
