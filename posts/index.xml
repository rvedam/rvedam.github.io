          Hello blogosphere! Sorry for the long delay 3 year gap from my last post. After a long break during which I completed graduate school as well as starting a couple of other study groups for Atlanta Functional Programming, I decided to get back into the blogging game. During this time, looking at my current blog site and process to publishing new content, I decided to first update my site and its layout.
