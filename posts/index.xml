          September 1st marks 16 years since I graduated from University of Illinois with my BS in Mathematics &amp;amp; Computer Science, and I entered the software industry officially. A lot has changed since then, from how we develop software to how we manage software projects, to how software companies are established. So much has changed so quickly in the last 16 years that it prompted me to start looking back to where the industry was at the time I started, in an effort to understand the evolution and more importantly figure out if some modern trends were making more sense than others.

          Hello blogosphere! Sorry for the long 3 year gap from my last post. After a long break during which I completed graduate school as well as starting a couple of other study groups for Atlanta Functional Programming, I decided to get back into the blogging game. During this time, looking at my current blog site and process to publishing new content, I decided to first update my site and its layout.
