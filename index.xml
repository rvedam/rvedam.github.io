          Hello blogosphere! Sorry for the long delay 3 year gap from my last post. After a long break during which I completed graduate school as well as starting a couple of other study groups for Atlanta Functional Programming, I decided to get back into the blogging game. During this time, looking at my current blog site and process to publishing new content, I decided to first update my site and its layout.

          While I rather not make this into a long professional bio, I will start by saying I am a seasoned developer. If you would like to know more about my experience please refer to my professional profile on LinkedIn for a more complete picture.
I code in many languages, although Common Lisp is one of my favorites. I code in it for fun and education, although recently I have been looking into do more work with it for some side projects.
