September 1st marks 16 years since I graduated from University of Illinois with 
my BS in Mathematics & Computer Science, and I entered the software industry 
officially. A lot has changed since then, from how we develop software to how 
we manage software projects, to how software companies are established. So much 
has changed so quickly in the last 16 years that it prompted me to start looking 
back to where the industry was at the time I started, in an effort to understand 
the evolution and more importantly figure out if some modern trends were making 
more sense than others.  I came to a few realizations about this, and I thought 
I'd write them down here.

I'm sure some of you might ask "Why write about this now?". The world as 
we know it has transformed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and while many industries
are still adjusting to this new environment with remote work, the software 
industry has been blazing trails with many companies actually shutting down their
facilities in favor of a full remote workforce (more on this observation later). 
While one might think this is unprecedented even for the software community, this 
was a long time coming and was one of the realizations that I had while I 
embarked on this journey into looking back and understand how we got here.

As I write these down, I hope to start up a discussion to see if other folks 
are observing similar things and are coming to the same conclusions. Hopefully, 
we can have a meaningful discussion, maybe even figure other changes that are 
required. 

That's it for now. Stay Tuned!
