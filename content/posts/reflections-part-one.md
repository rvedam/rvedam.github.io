_As of September 2021, I will officially complete 14 years as a professional 
software engineer. In this series of posts, I look back and reflect on the 
advancement of the industry as a whole, and provide some realizations
I've had over the years._

## Introduction

Software development as a discipline really took off in ways I could not have 
imagined since I graduated with my undergraduate degree in 2005. At that time,
we were still witnessing the aftermath of the dotcom bust, and a regression 
back slightly to using enterprise environments with a focus on shrink-wrapped 
software with the rise of Web 2.0 and a new slew of developments in what
is now called the "Cloud" just on the horizon.
