While I rather not make this into a long professional bio, I will start by 
saying I am a seasoned developer. If you would like to know more about my 
experience please refer to my professional profile on LinkedIn for a more 
complete picture.

I code in many languages, although Common Lisp is one of my favorites. I code in
it for fun and education, although recently I have been looking into do more work 
with it for some side projects. Hopefully, time permitting, these projects and 
ideas will lead to something that I can show all in the blogosphere (if not it'll 
be a github repo for people to fork, and hopefully critique)

I am an advocate for functional programming and am interested in its role in the 
technology landscape as it gets wider adoption. I am also interested in the 
continuous evolution of both the field of computer science and the software industry 
in general. To further pursue these interests, I organize and give talks online for 
the Atlanta Functional Programming Meetup. A couple of these activities include
the following study groups (held virtually weekly and livestreamed via Youtube):

* CL Study group
* Haskell Study Group

Please join us! More information about these meetups are available on the
Atlanta Functional Programming meetup page.
